# SkillConnect - Learn Together, Solve Together
SkillConnect is a modern, web-based platform designed to facilitate collaborative coding and enhance preparation for technical interviews. The project addresses the growing need for an integrated environment where developers can practice data structures and algorithms (DSA), engage in real-time pair programming, and receive instant feedback on their code. The system features a multi-language code execution engine supporting Python, JavaScript, Java, C, and C++, complete with automatic dependency management. Its architecture combines a React.js frontend for a dynamic user experience, a Django backend for robust user authentication, and a Node.js server with Socket.IO for real-time collaboration and code execution. SkillConnect aims to provide a seamless and efficient learning experience by bridging the gap between individual practice and collaborative problem-solving.
